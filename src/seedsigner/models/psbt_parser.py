    change, the fee, where the spend is going, and any OP_RETURN payload.

    Constructing it with a seed parses immediately; see parse() for what that establishes
    in what order and which psbts it turns away.

    The parse fully processes the psbt, validates what it can, then stores the organized
    results in the instance attributes (spend_amount, fee_amount, destination_addresses,
    etc.). Note that change_data and change_amount cover EVERY output coming back to this
    seed, including self-transfers to a receive address. The view layer tells the two
    apart by the branch index in the derivation path.

    A psbt is written by an untrusted coordinator. The metadata it carries about keys
    (fingerprints, derivation paths, xpubs) is a claim, not a fact. The onus is on us to
    verify by re-deriving from the signing seed. For multisig, verification depends on the
    user providing a "known good" descriptor (i.e. can be trusted) from which we can
    verify the outputs by deriving from the cosigners' xpubs.

    This class makes the difference visible in its own names:

      claimed_...   coordinator-supplied metadata (fingerprints, derivation paths, xpubs).
                    Safe to read and display; never safe to make a decision on.
      verified_...  a fact this device proved by re-deriving from the signing seed and
                    matching real key material. Only assigned by code that performed that
                    derivation.

    Invariant: no verified_ value is ever assigned from a claimed_ value without an
    intervening re-derivation from self.root or from a user-supplied "known good"
    descriptor.

    The invariant is enforced, not merely documented: a claim that cannot be turned
    into a fact is refused rather than displayed. See RejectCode for the specific
    constructions that have no honest explanation, and RiskWarning for the ones that
    do and are surfaced for review instead.

             psbt must be one whose bytes can only mean one transaction before any of its
             claims are worth reading. See RejectCode.

          1. _fill_missing_fingerprints: backfills all-zero fingerprints, but only for
             scopes the seed provably derives.

          2. _verify_claimed_derivation_paths: each input and output scope that claims to
             be controlled by the seed is verified. Raises InvalidPSBTError with
             RejectCode.FORGED_[INPUT|OUTPUT]_OWNERSHIP if a claimed scope fails
             verification. The claims that survive are then checked for shape
             (_verify_claim_shapes: SURPLUS_DERIVATIONS, MIXED_DERIVATION_MAPS) and,
             on outputs, against the script they sit on
             (_verify_output_claims_match_scripts: FORGED_OUTPUT_OWNERSHIP).

          3. _reject_if_seed_cannot_sign: raises RejectCode.SEED_CANNOT_SIGN if none of
             the inputs can be signed by the seed. A mismatch rather than an attack,
             caught here so the flow can say so before showing a transaction.

             Steps 2 and 3 need a BIP32 tree to derive against, so both are skipped when
             there is none -- WIF / BIP38 signing, or a seedless multisig pre-parse. See
             can_verify_derivations.

          4. _parse_inputs: every input must resolve to the same policy, otherwise
             RejectCode.MIXED_INPUTS. Each input is also structurally validated here
             (RejectCode.MISSING_UTXO, UNSUPPORTED_SIGHASH, and the rest).

             A policy is one of:
               - single-sig: the script type alone. Says nothing about keys.
               - multisig, cosigners resolved: script type, m-of-n, and the cosigner
                 xpubs that every key in the script was traced back to.
               - multisig, cosigners unresolved: script type and m-of-n only.
                 _get_policy doesn't propagate cosigner errors, so two such policies match
                 without anything having tied them to the same keys. TODO: don't let a
                 policy with no cosigner information pass as a match.

          5. _parse_outputs: works out which outputs come back to this seed. For
             single-sig this proves the output script derives from the seed at the
             claimed path. TODO: reject outputs at a path the user's wallet would never
             scan.

        Optimization via child_key_derivation_cache:
        Parsing traverses a derivation path down to an individual address one level at a
        time, over and over, and where that traversal begins depends on the wallet.

        Single-sig traverses the full path down from our own master key, on every OUTPUT
        the PSBT claims is ours.

        Multisig instead traverses just the last two levels down from each cosigner's
        account xpub, once per cosigner, on every INPUT and on every OUTPUT carrying the
        multisig script.

        Deriving each level costs a hash and an elliptic curve operation, and these
        traversals overlap heavily: everything in one account shares the same opening
        levels, differing only in the address at the end.

        So every level derived during this parse is kept in a cache and reused. See
        _derive_with_cache.

        Note that the cache is only useful within a single parse so it is not preserved.

        """********************* How output ownership is determined *********************
        Many outputs are obviously NOT ours. An output is only considered possible
        change if its policy matches the inputs' policy "shape" (script type, plus m-of-n
        for multisig; see parse()); anything else is recorded as an external spend.

        The psbt will usually annotate which key(s) a change output pays (see embit's
        bip32_derivations and taproot_bip32_derivations), but this is just a claim
        supplied by the coordinator. These annotations are not authoritative. But such
        claims are significant; if our checks prove that the claim is false, we consider
        the deception an attack.

        -- Proving the claim --
        The output's scriptPubKey determines where the value ACTUALLY goes. But the
        scriptPubKey only contains a hash of the spending conditions (note: taproot uses a
        tweaked key instead), so we can't simply inspect the scriptPubKey to determine if
        the output is ours.

        We must build our own version of the scriptPubKey via:
          * single sig: derive a key from our seed using the claimed derivation path.
          * multisig: hash the claimed witness_script or redeem_script, then check that a
            key derived from our seed is among that script's keys.

        That leaves us holding two independent answers about the same output: which key it
        commits to (our rebuild, matched against the scriptPubKey), and which key the psbt
        says it commits to (the claim). We evaluate the output on those two facts:

                                     | claims this seed     | doesn't claim this seed
            -------------------------+----------------------+-------------------------
            commits to our key       | presumed change      | contradiction
            commits to another key   | contradiction        | presumed external spend

        If our two answers contradict each other, the psbt has been caught in a deception.
        We raise an exception and reject the psbt.

        Multisig change can't be fully verified until later in the process, so we use
        "presumed" to avoid conveying a false impression of certainty. Single sig carries
        its own note later in this function about its guarantees.

        (note one exception: no taproot mismatch is rejected. A script tree tweaks our
        internal key, so an honest taproot change output fails to match too, and we cannot
        yet tell that apart from an output that claims our key but pays someone else. All
        taproot mismatches pass as EXTERNAL spends and are never considered "change".)
