Every refusal message has to fit on a 240x240 screen.

`TextArea` does not raise when text overflows its rect -- it logs a warning and
renders past the bottom edge, straight over the button. So an overlong refusal
reason produces a visually broken screen that nothing else catches. These tests
measure the real layout and fail if a message no longer fits.
